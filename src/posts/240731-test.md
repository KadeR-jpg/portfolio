### Intro
Hello, i hope that you are enjoying clicking around here.
If you missed any of the other stuff. My name is Kade and i am a software engineer with a degree in computer science.
I really love full-stack development, being able to hop around and do different things keeps it all interesting.
When i have free time i also really like doing some creative stuff like drawing and designing logos, just for fun.
Anyways, this isn't really suppose to be anything crazy. I just knew that i wasn't going to write any thing with
substance this week and wanted to push my changes anyways.
