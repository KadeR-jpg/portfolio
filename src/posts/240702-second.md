## I really like music.

I had this idea to make these little capsules that are 5 songs that really encapsulate my month. There is no reason as to why or what goes into them, just 5 songs that i really enjoyed for whatever reason. I thought that it could be a fun way to visibly represent a month for me through music. Giving anyone the ability to look back and see what i was thinking/feeling that month.
Look through the stack below, clicking on them will shuffle them through. Click on the song title to take you to it's spotify page.

### I got married this month!
This had a big influenced on what i was listening to. It's a happy and fun month :)
