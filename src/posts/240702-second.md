## I clearly really like music.

I have had this idea to make these little capsules that are 5 songs that really encapsulate my month. There is no reason as to why or what goes into them, just 5 songs that i really enjoyed for whatever reason. I thought that it could be a fun way to be able to visibly represent them. Being able to look back and see what i was thinking/feeling that month.

#### I got married this month!

That influenced a lot of my picks. It's a happy and fun month :)
