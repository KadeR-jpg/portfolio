## I Really Like Music.

I had this idea awhile ago to make these little capsules that are 5 songs that really capture my month, in whatever way. Songs that i listened to the most or ones that just really resonated with me. There is no real reason, just a feeling. I thought that it could be a fun way to visibly represent a month for me through music. Giving anyone the ability to look back and see what I feeling that month, a little time-capsule if you will.

Look through them, click on it to shuffle through the five. Click on the songs' title if you want to listen to it (on spotify)

### I got married this month!

This had an obviously large influence on what I was listening to. It's a happy and fun month :)
