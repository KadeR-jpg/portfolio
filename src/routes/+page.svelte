		I am passionate about programming, learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies.
		This website was my first solo project out of school and i have just been chucking new things on
		it and revising it for fun. I use it as an opportunity to build little pointless things because

		there for fun. This site is built with Sveltekit and TailwindCSS.
