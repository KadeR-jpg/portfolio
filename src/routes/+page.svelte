    I am a software engineer with 4+ years of experience. Currently working in the biotech/medical
    field. I build AI workflows and data pipelines for cancer research. The last year has mostly
    been spent wrangling LLMs into doing useful things with scientific literature. Which is usually

    The site has been a little playground since I graduated college. I have been rebuilding it and
    breaking it for years. It's my little chunk of the internet, some of the choices probably don't
    make sense. I am sure I get more joy watching a little spinning record of what I am currently
    listening to than you will. That's fine. Welcome.
