# Kade Pitsch, personal portfolio
I have chosen to write a portfolio that i plan on expanding into solely a personal site in the future which will hopefully speak enough to my abilities as a full-stack developer.
## Svelte
I chose to use Svelte because i have previous experience with it. I love how simple it was to set up and get everything working in svelte. I have a feeling that learning Svelte falls in the category as easy to learn but hard to master. I made a lot of progress learning Svelte to publish this site but i know there is much more to learn.
## TailwindCSS
I never liked writing CSS, i do not like the disconnect of having an element that you specifically name, scroll to where ever that exist in your file and edit it, change it and do whatever you need to do. Then repeat that for whatever other element. I like the simplicity of inline styling. Tailwind can get ugly but if it gets to large and ugly, i just break it out and apply it to a layer.
