# Kade Pitsch, personal portfolio

I have chosen to write a portfolio that i plan on expanding into solely a personal site in the future which will hopefully speak enough to my abilities as a full-stack developer.

## Svelte(kit)

My reason for choosing this is i never liked react's state management solution and prefer the baked in reactivity of svelte as well us the DX of the entire project

## TailwindCSS

Reason? I like it and don't like writing vanilla CSS

## Vercel
